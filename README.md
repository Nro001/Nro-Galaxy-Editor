# Stellaris-Map-Editor

PROJECT ON HIATUS, I HAVE SUMMER CLASS AND I SPENT A WHOLE WEEK PROCRASTINATING BY CODING THIS THING WHOLE WEEK
Possible problem: hyperlanes have bridge=yes variable now so I have to make a code that will cycle through it so I can remove it 

Update: Tested removing all the length on a savefile, it works but it turns into length=0 after looking at the map, might be used for distance travel?

Update2 :Cleaned the test files except for the saves, optimized decode and encode, however due to new codes added, I have to clean it later again, goal is to test if it works first.

>Added else if statement because the string goes bananas and decides to switch to another pattern especially %s+

>Can read then write then replace

>The replaced version works and does not crash anymore, although changing the values is not guaranted

>Positions can be changed, doesn't seem to crash

>However, editing hyperlanes is the issue right now since they cause the crash when I try to mass edit

>Now detects bridge=yes variable from hyperlane, (what are they use for??)

Project on hiatus, spent a week doing this, still have summer classes so, will take a break in a month

Problems with hyperlane still but the coordinates now work
