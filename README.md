# Nro001 Galaxy Charter

_As a Type-5 Kardashev being, you are able to move the stars of a mere galaxy and manipulate their waypoints as you please with just a divine click of a button._

This small project was made to generate visual map to edit the position of stars, dis/connect hyperlanes and group nebulas. I completely remade it three years after. This is also my first finished project so if there are any issues, post them [here](https://github.com/neroiii/Stellaris_Galaxy_Editor/issues).
I made every pixel art and code for this project!

Instructions and Usage
========================
The editor requires a `save-file`, it is not made for creating new galaxies but to edit the map, so it can be used at any point in time of the game. Keep in mind that the processing takes a while the longer the game has been. Post your creations on the [discussions](https://github.com/neroiii/Stellaris_Galaxy_Editor/discussions)!

**The current version doesn't require you to extract your gamestate anymore, it can now directly save and load your file** 
However, if you want the old way or the direct method is not working, follow `gamestate-method` below.
